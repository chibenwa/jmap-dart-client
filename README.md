# JMAP Dart client

A [JMAP](https://jmap.io/) client library to make JMAP method calls and process the responses.

We most notably use it to write the [TMail Flutter application](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter) but you might reuse this library to write your own JMAP application.

We do welcome all contributions, given decent test coverage and acceptable code quality.

Please report any problem, any feature request, or discuss how you plan to use this lib in the repository [issues](https://github.com/linagora/jmap-dart-client/issues).
